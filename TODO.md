- Bonus trait revealed on pre-exercise screen: "This time, focus on your [ACCURACY/whatever/whatever]!" Grant bonus points I guess, but really it's to incentivize mindfulness.
	- Rarely get challenged to focus on two at once?

- Inject random tips?

- Maybe replace score with "exercises completed" and "average percent" (the latter being color-coded in the usual way"

- Still use the score internally and populate a starfield on two flanking canvases or something
	- or what if I used globalAlpha to make the canvas background partially transparent each time the canvas is cleared and used the entire background for a subtle silhouette garden or something? IDK, big plans

- Count total exercises completed? Completed out of scheduled once Lesson Mode is in?

- Speaking of, Lesson Mode: currently the next exercise is chosen at random, but Lesson Mode would load a list.

- "Freedraw" exercise mode, you have X strokes to complete something

- "Connect the dots" exercise mode where, true to the name, there's no line stroke for the teacher's lines 

- Opacity as a grading measure

- Disable (hide) anything with a score mult of 0

- Maybe the left side is stroke grades/num strokes, right side is overall percents/overall exercises completed. Score is only used for percents and for adding some kind of decor to the screen.

- Add site link to README

- Allow exercises to be hidden so they don't show in random mode
